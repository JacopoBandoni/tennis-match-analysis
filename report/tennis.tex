\section{Introduction}
In this report, we address several data mining tasks. We start with the analysis of a dataset containing tennis matches by doing data understanding and feature engineering with the aim of applying a clustering analysis to identify interesting patterns among the players' profiles. Then we perform a prediction analysis with the aim of discriminating strong players from weak ones. Finally, there is a time series analysis on a dataset of the temperatures of some world cities.

\section{Data understanding}

\subsection{Dataset overview}
The \texttt{tennis\_matches} dataset contains $\textbf{186128}$ total observations and in the following image \ref{fig:null_count} we can see a summary of the null values for each attribute.

\subsubsection{Feature understanding}
Below, the semantic analysis for each of the $\textbf{48}$ attributes:

%Below, the semantic analysis for each of the $\textbf{48}$ attributes and the relative distribution for a few of the most significant:
\paragraph{tourney\_id}
The identifier of the tourney. There are 4854 unique tourneys.

\paragraph{tourney\_name}
The name of the tourney. There are 2488 unique names. The unique values are lower than those of tourney\_id, hence more tournaments with the same name have been played over the years. Moreover, several naming conventions are used from which partial information about the host city name, prize, nationalities could be scraped.

\paragraph{surface}
The type of surface on which the players had the game. The types are the following with their respective occurrences: Hard (95127), Clay (81013), Grass (6600), Carpet (3053).

\paragraph{draw\_size}
The number of players in the draw, that is often rounded up to the next power of $2$. The most common draw size for a tourney is $32$ followed by $2,4,64$.

\paragraph{tourney\_level}
The level of the tourney that is different for men and women, and hence it gives information about the sex of a tournament. There are 19 unique values. They are mostly character, but for ITF competitions it's an integer that states the prize. The only ambiguous level is the $D$ that is used both for men and women, but it can be disambiguated thanks to the fact that for men it's used only in the tourney whose name is “Davis Cup F.” Moreover, $O$ is a category used to denote the Olympics, where both men and women can participate.

\paragraph{tourney\_date}
The date when the tourney started.
The matches were disputed between the year $2016$ and $2021$, with most of them in the range $2016-2019$. For the months, instead, November and December tends to be the one with fewer matches. More than 97\% of them are on Monday.

\paragraph{match\_num}
A match-specific identifier. Often starting from 1, sometimes counting down from 300, and sometimes arbitrary.

\paragraph{winner\_id, loser\_id}
The player\_id used in this dataset for the winner/loser of the match.

\paragraph{winner\_entry, loser\_entry}
is an acronym that indicates how a player is qualified in a tournament. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|Q| (Qualifier): player who reaches the tournament's main draw by competing in a pre-tournament qualifying competition instead of automatically qualified by virtue of their world ranking, being a wild card, or other exemption.
    \item \verb|WC| (Wild Card): player allowed to play in a tournament, even if their rank is not adequate or they do not register in time. Typically, a few places in the draw are reserved for wild cards, which may be for local players who do not gain direct acceptance or for players who are just outside the ranking required to gain direct acceptance. Wild cards may also be given to players whose ranking has dropped due to a long-term injury.
    \item \verb|LL| (Lucky Loser): player or team that gains acceptance into the main draw of a tournament when a main draw player or team withdraws.
\end{itemize}
and many others.

\paragraph{winner\_hand, loser\_hand}
The hand used by the player. For ambidextrous players, this is their serving hand. A possible value for those attributes is 'U' which stands for unknown, and it matches $49k$ and $62k$ for winners and losers entry respectively.

\paragraph{winner\_name, loser\_name}
Winner's/loser's name.

\paragraph{winner\_ht, loser\_ht}
Winner's/loser's height in centimetres

\paragraph{winner\_ioc, loser\_ioc}
Winner's/loser's three-character country code.

\paragraph{winner\_age, loser\_age}
Winner's/loser's age, in years, depending on the date of the tournament.

\paragraph{round}
An acronym which identifies the stage of the match inside the tournament (e.g., 'f' stands for 'final', 'sf' for 'semifinal' and so on).

\paragraph{score}
The score of the match.
Every couple n1-n2 (e.g., 6-4) represents the score of a single set, where n1 are the games won by the winner and n2 those won by the loser of the match.
When after the couple of numbers representing a set there is a number n3 between brackets (e.g., 7-6(4)), it means that the set ended at the tie-break and n3 represents the points scored during it by the loser of the set.
When we find a couple between square brackets (e.g., [10-7]), it represents the result of the super tie-break, which is played in some tourneys, on the 6-6 of the last set (on the 12-12 in Wimbledon). In these cases, the score of the final set is omitted.
We can also find some abbreviations, which indicate particular conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|RET, Ret., RE, RET+64|. Placed at the end of the score, to indicate the retirement of a player during the match.
    \item \verb|W/O, Walkover|. It's the retirement of a player before the match starts. 
    \item \verb|DEF, Def.|. It's a default, i.e., the disqualification of a player.
    \item \verb|BYE|. It's the automatic advancement of a player to the next round of a tournament without facing an opponent.
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, there are some errors: not recognized characters (16 times), HTML non-breaking spaces (15), “RET” without a score before (8), “2-May”, “1-Feb” and a score with a wrong formatting.

\paragraph{best-of}
The maximum number of sets of the match. If “3”, it means that the first player to achieve 2 sets, wins the match. If "5", a player must achieve 3 sets to win.

\paragraph{minutes}
The duration of the match.

\paragraph{w\_ace, l\_ace}
Winner's/loser's number of aces.

\paragraph{w\_df, l\_df}
Winner's/loser's number of double faults.

\paragraph{w\_svpt, l\_svpt}
Winner's/loser's number of serve points.

\paragraph{w\_1stIn, l\_1stIn}
Winner's/loser's number of first serves made.

\paragraph{w\_1stWon, l\_1stWon}
Winner's/loser's number of first-serve points won.

\paragraph{w\_2ndWon, l\_2ndWon}
Winner's/loser's number of second-serve points won.

\paragraph{w\_SvGms, l\_SvGms}
Winner's/loser's number of serve games.

\paragraph{w\_bpSaved, l\_bpSaved}
Winner's/loser's number of breakpoints saved.

\paragraph{w\_bpFaced, l\_bpFaced}
Winner's/loser's number of breakpoints faced.

\paragraph{winner\_rank, loser\_rank}
Winner's/loser's ATP or WTA rank, as of the tourney\_date, or the most recent ranking date before the tourney\_date.

\paragraph{winner\_rank\_points, loser\_rank\_points}
Number of ranking points.

\paragraph{tourney\_spectators}
The number of total spectators of the tourney.

\paragraph{tourney\_revenue}
The total tournament earnings.

\section{Data cleaning and transformation}

First we switched all the letters in lowercase, since in some cases there were equivalent values considered as different (e.g., “US Open” and “Us Open” in tourney\_name), we also removed leading, trailing and double spaces where present because they could lead as well into the same kind of problems. Then we applied the following changes:

\paragraph{score}
We set to NaN all the erroneous values. We also added the omitted final set score in the matches with super tie-break, in order to be able to compute the number of games won by the winner and those won by the loser. Lastly, we uniformed the different strings that represented the same concept (e.g., “w/o” and “walkover”).

\paragraph{minutes}
This attribute was full of outliers. In particular, we noticed that all the values grater than 396 were not possible, also in relation to the score of the matches. So we substituted these values with NaN.

\paragraph{loser\_ht}
Several outliers with loser\_ht = 2.0 $\ref{fig:loser_ht_boxplot}$, even in this case we decide to search on the internet the correct values and replace those with the outliers. 

\paragraph{winner\_ht}
Several outliers with winner\_ht = 2.0 and also other outliers with height $<$ 146 $\ref{fig:winner_ht_boxplot}$. In this case, we decide to search on the internet the correct values and replace those with the outliers.

\paragraph{winner\_age}
There were two players with two occurrences having as winner\_age 95 years $\ref{fig:winner_age_boxplot}$. Then we decide to replace those values with the medium age of the corresponding players.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{w\_svpt, w\_1stIn, w\_1stWon, w\_2ndWon and corresponding of the loser}
We noticed that for all these attributes there were 5 recurrent records in which the values were extremely high and not possible, also in relation to the score of the matches. We dropped these records.

\section{Players dataset}
In this chapter we will create a new $\textbf{player dataset}$ where we will define new features interesting for describing the player profile and his behaviour derivable from matches.
\subsection{Feature engineering}

\paragraph{gender}
The sex of the player. We obtained it performing a join with the datasets. For each player where the gender was missing, we replaced that gender by checking in all his game the most frequent gender's opponent.

\paragraph{matches\_won\_ratio}
The ratio between the number of the total games won and the total numbers of games played.

\paragraph{mean\_performance\_index, max\_performance\_index, min\_performance\_index }
The minimum, the maximum and the average value of the performance index, which is the ratio between the number of matches played by the player in a tourney and the number of matches he should have played in order to win the tourney.

\paragraph{mean\_minutes, max\_minutes, minutes\_entropy }
The average, the maximum, and the Shannon entropy of the duration of the matches played by a player.

\paragraph{rel\_ace, rel\_df, rel\_1stIn, rel\_1stWon, rel\_2ndWon}
The average of the ratios between the statistics (ace, df etc.) and the number of serve points of the player in the single matches.

\paragraph{1stWonOnTotWon}
The average of the ratios between the first serve point won and player's total serve points in the single matches.

\paragraph{2ndWonOnTotWon}
The average of the ratios between the second serve point won and the total points won by the player in the single matches.

\paragraph{rel\_bpFaced}
The average of the ratios between the breakpoints faced and the player's total serve points in the single matches.

\paragraph{rel\_bpSaved}
The average of the ratios between the breakpoints saved, and the breakpoint faced by the player in the single matches.

\paragraph{rel\_ptsWon}
The average of the ratios between the points scored and the total by the player in the single matches.

\paragraph{rel\_gmsWon}
The average of the ratios between the breakpoints saved, and the breakpoint faced by the player in the single matches.

\paragraph{lrpOnAvgrp}
The ratio between the player's last ranking points (last\_rank\_points) and his average ones (mean\_rank\_points).

	\label{fig:lrpOnAvrgrp_Hist}
	\captionof{figure}{lrpOnAvgrp Histogram}\label{fig1}
\end{center}

\paragraph{lrpOnMxrp}
The ratio between the player's last ranking points (last\_rank\_points) and the maximum ones he ever achieved (max\_rank\_points).

% \paragraph{Note:}
% For that last two features we had to perform additional operations to ensure that the last value in chronological order was not null. In this way we could ensure that the newly created feature wouldn't be null.

\paragraph{Other trivial features}
name, gender, ht, age, hand, total\_tourneys\_played, total\_matches\_played,\\ total\_matches\_won, last\_rank\_points, mean\_rank\_points, max\_rank\_points, variance\_rank\_points, \\ mean\_tourney\_spectators, max\_tourney\_spectators, mean\_tourney\_revenue, max\_tourney\_revenue.

\subsection{Players dataset cleaning}
   \begin{itemize}
  	\item We  dropped  all  the  records  where \textit{lrpOnMxrp} (and  therefore  the  other  features  regarding  the  ranking points) had value null and we performed a mean imputation on the \textit{age} (4 missing values).
  	\item We removed all the players who have played less than 15 matches for the clustering or less than 4 in the case of classification.
